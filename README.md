#1

Write an application that computes the total ticket sales of a concert. There are three types of seatings: 
A, B, and C. the program accepts the number of tickets sold and the price of a ticket for each of the 
three types of seats. The total sales are computed as 
totalSales = numberOfA_Seats * pricePerA_Seat +
numberOfB_Seats * pricePerB_Seat +
numberOfC_Seats * pricePerC_Seat ;
Write this application using an instantiable SeatType class. An instance of the SeatType class keeps track 
of the ticket price for a given type of seat (A, B, or C) and the number of tickets sold for each seat type. 
(Hint: Create objects called seatA, seatB, and seatC to track the sales).


#2

Lab02_Task02
Write a very simple but complete class. The class represents a counter that counts 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,....
• The name of the class should be Counter.
• It has one private instance variable representing the value of the counter.
• It has two instance methods: 
o increment() adds one to the counter value, and
o getValue() returns the current counter value.
Write a complete definition for the class, Counter.

Lab02_Task03
Modify class Account (Fig. 1) to provide a method called debit that withdraws money from an Account. 
Ensure that the debit amount does not exceed the Account’s balance. If it does, the balance should be 
left unchanged and the method should print a message indicating "Debit amount exceeded account 
balance." Modify class AccountTest (Fig. 2) to test method debit.


#4

Lab02_Task04
Modify class GradeBook (Fig. 3). Include a second String instance variable that represents the name of 
the course’s instructor. Provide a set method to change the instructor’s name and a get method to 
retrieve it. Modify the constructor to specify two parameter one for the course name and one for the 
instructor’s name. Modify method displayMessage such that it first outputs the welcome message and 
course name, then outputs "This course is presented by: " followed by the instructor’s name. Modify the 
test application (Fig. 4) to demonstrate the class’s new capabilities

#5

Lab02_Task05
Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as instance variables—a first 
name (type String), a last name (type String) and a monthly salary (type double). Your class should have 
a constructor that initializes the three instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each 
instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive, set it to 0.0. Write a test application named 
EmployeeTest that demonstrates class Employee’s capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display 
the yearly salary for each Employee. Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee’s 
yearly salary again

Lab03_Task06
Write an application that computes the total ticket sales of a concert. There are three types of seatings: 
A, B, and C. the program accepts the number of tickets sold and the price of a ticket for each of the 
three types of seats. The total sales are computed as 
totalSales = numberOfA_Seats * pricePerA_Seat +
numberOfB_Seats * pricePerB_Seat +
numberOfC_Seats * pricePerC_Seat ;
Write this application using an instantiable SeatType class. An instance of the SeatType class keeps track 
of the ticket price for a given type of seat (A, B, or C) and the number of tickets sold for each seat type. 
(Hint: Create objects called seatA, seatB, and seatC to track the sales).
